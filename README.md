# Modules
This is a set of Jai modules, for use widely across all of my projects. 
A few modules are modified versions of the ones shipped with the Jai compiler, such as the Apollo_Time module.  
The IO module is inspired from one of the modules in the Odin core module library, although it is not used very much.
